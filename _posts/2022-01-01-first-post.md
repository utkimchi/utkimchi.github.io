# Main Purpose

Having worked with Markdown exetensively in Jupyter Notebooks, I'm pumped to find Jekyll (Github Pages) using Markdown files! I'm planning to mainly use this blog to give an outlet for my thoughts and notes on papers that I read. I'll be focusing on the fields on machine learning, social-environmental systems, and modelling techniques.

## Secondary?

Just wanted to test out LateX. Someone e-mail me and let me know how to get that set up! Maybe it's best I don't use any scientific notation in this blog. Makes reading this a little easier.

### Tertiary

Anyone else think that plenary reminds them of some sort of planetary gathering? Below is a paper for my ML course. See if you can access it.

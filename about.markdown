# Howdy! 

My name is Colton Avila and I'm currently a Graduate Research Assistant at Oregon State University pursuing my M.S. in Biological and Ecological Engineering. 

Feel free to take a look [at my resume](https://utkimchi.github.io/assets/Colton_Avila_Resume_2021.pdf) and shoot me an e-mail if you have any questions!
